# machinenursery - Jen and Mark try to work out how to do machine learning

To train up a Weka neural networks classifier:

lein uberjar
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m" java -cp target/machinenursery-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar main.java.WekaNeuralNetworks

It will write the serialized version into weka-attempts/neural-networks so make sure you have that folder or it will blow up
